Project 3 - 3CG

The font used is Minecraft Standard:
https://www.dafont.com/minecraft-standard.font

Programming Patterns Used:
- Update: LOVE2D uses update() and draw() functions.
- State: cards have different states that are utilized by the grabber class.

Unfortunately I don't really have enough code to say that I've used any programming patterns. I've been confused about many of them and I'm not sure what else to say.

Feedback:

I did not get a chance to ask anyone for feedback, because my program has not been in a usable state.

Postmortem:

This assignment went terribly, and despite having written a lot of code, I barely have anything working. I'm pretty sure this whole thing is barely worth 5 points :C
I sent an email to Zac detailing my situation and I'm hoping for a potential grade boost or something to mitigate this assignment going poorly. That said, I know exactly where I went wrong.

My programming style is very very thorough and perfectionist. I spend a lot of time planning things out on paper or using other tools before actually writing code, and I commit to doing things in ways that make sense to me. However, this has the unfortunate side effect of sometimes causing me to focus on the wrong things at the wrong times. Sometimes it works out very well; in Project 1, I ended up getting extra credit points because those requirements were part of the plan to begin with. Unfortunately, on this Project, it ended up working against me. I spent way too long programming card positions, finding a nice font, and all sorts of other small details that are just not important. I didn't realize how much of a problem that was until the deadline started creeping up. The actual game logic has been much more difficult to reason about and implement than I expected, and I didn't get any of it working.

My approach to the game logic itself was also a mistake in terms of getting things done. I tried to do a lot of things differently from before for the sake of learning. More specifically, I wanted to implement a proper grabber class because I didn't do so in the Solitaire project. I also wanted to try to use some new programming patterns. But I soon realized that I really don't understand these patterns well enough to comfortably use them, and I lost a lot of time from writing so many things from scratch when I probably didn't have to.

I'm not really sure what happens next, as I still need to hear back from Zac. But for the Final Project, I'd like to try to study up on some programming patterns and see which ones I can use for this project.
